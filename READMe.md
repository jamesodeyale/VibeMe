<h1><center>Welcome to VibeMe<center></h1>
<h4>VibeMe is a passion project automates the process of creating a playlist based on a particular routine. </h4>
  <p>I love to listen to music and I love to entertain myself when carrying out a task or a routine. I find that for me this puts me in my most productive and efficient state. However, I hate the stress of having to create a new playlist everytime so I end up just switching to play radio of a particular song on Spotify which inevidable puts some songs I do not like in the playlist. </p> 
<p>  This is where VibeMe comes in. With VibeMe you can create a Spotify playlist based on the particular genre you want on the playlist and we would map this to your most listened to artist for that genre and the best songs for that as well as some amazing songs in that genre you might not even be familiar with.</p>


<p>I am also documenting this entire process of creating this application on my Youtube Channel so you can follow all the way.</p>
